        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <dl>
            <dt>Is this a wedding?</dt>
            <dd>Yes! Think of this celebration as an elopement that we could not have imagined without the presence of our immediate families and closest friends. We have intentionally stripped this day down so we can focus on only that which is essential and most sacred to us.</dd>

            <dt>What are the details for the day's events?</dt>
            <dd>The ceremony will be held at the Colon Public Library in the Smith Room at 3:30 PM. Please plan to arrive between 3:00 and 3:15. After the ceremony, head across the street to Curly's for a quick drink before dinner. Guests may start arriving at Farrand Hall at 5:30 PM, where you can enjoy beer, wine, and NA beverages on us. Dinner starts at 6:30 PM. For more excitement, check Farrand Hall's website.</dd>

            <dt>What is the dress code?</dt>
            <dd>Please keep it casual with us. Our wedding day will be intimate and unconventional, and we want your comfort to be reflected in that. Farrand Hall does not have a dress code and recommends to each guest: “come as you are.” We will be dressing up a bit, but we invite you to join us in prioritizing simplicity over formality. Practical shoes are encouraged as you will be walking on grass and gravel. Per groom's wishes ties are highly discouraged.</dd>

            <dt>Gifts/registry?</dt>
            <dd>We have all that we need in life and we view your presence on this day as a gift in itself. Your time is truly the most precious thing you can give us. If you feel strongly about giving us a gift, we will accept contributions toward our honeymoon fund (cash, check, Venmo, and of course Bitcoin). You are also welcome to make a small donation to the Colon Public Library in our names.</dd>

            <dt>Do I need to RSVP?</dt>
            <dd>Since we purchased dinner tickets individually ahead of time for each guest, we have likely already been in touch about whether you can make it. We understand that life is unpredictable, though, so if something comes up, please let us know!</dd>
